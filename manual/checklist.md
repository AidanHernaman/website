When you first join the lab (ideally within the first week), you will have a
meeting with Leo to undergo the steps below for your induction.

## Before your meeting

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Make sure you remember
   your user name. Make it something professional (this will be associated with
   your future publications from the lab).

## During your meeting

You will be added to:

1. The lab Slack chatroom. This is where most of our communication happens.
1. The lab GitHub organization
   ([github.com/compgeolab](https://github.com/compgeolab/)). All projects will
   be developed here.
1. Group Google calendar. Leo will put in shared events, meetings, conferences,
   and times when he'll be away.
1. This website. Each member gets a page in [/people]. **You can opt-out of
   having your page** if you don't want one. If you do want one, you can modify
   the contents at any time and add a (somewhat professional) photo if you'd
   like.

The we'll go over this document:

1. Mental Health Resources
1. Code of Conduct
1. Expectations (openness, what we expect from you, what you can expect from
   us)
1. Communication modes
1. Check-ins, feedback, and meetings

## After your meeting

1. Read the [Code of Conduct][/manual/coc] carefully.
1. Go over this document again on your own (ask on Slack if you have any
   questions).
1. Create your account on Slack from the invitation you should have received.
1. Edit your page on the website (if you want).
1. Explore the GitHub organization to see what the group is working on.
1. Go and start making something brilliant!
