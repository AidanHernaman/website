This document is designed to be a reference document for lab members as well as part of
an induction process when people join the lab. It outlines our practices, core
principals, ethics, and expectations.

**It is a living document:** lab members are encouraged to submit pull requests to
improve/update it.
The source files for the manual can be found in the `manual` folder of
[github.com/compgeolab/website](https://github.com/compgeolab/website).
