This month, lab members [/people/lcooper], [/people/sheer], [/people/aborges],
and [/people/cthomson] have successfully finished their dissertations and have
all graduated from the University of Liverpool! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ
All four have received high marks for their work and Steven received an award
for his dissertation.

I'm, of course, extremely proud of them all. It was a pleasure to get to know
them throughout the year and I've learned a lot along the way.
Their arrival is what motivated the creation of the [lab manual][/manual] and
their work is providing a model for a
[dissertation template](https://github.com/compgeolab/dissertation-template)
that will facilitate the on-boarding of new members in the 2020/21 cohort.

**Please join me in wishing the new geophysicists all the best in their future
careers and lives in general!** ðŸ¥‚
