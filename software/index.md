Software is a requirement for much of the scientific inquiry done in the 21st
century. It's certainly a major part of what we do at the lab. We program
mostly in the Python language (with some C sprinkled in the middle). All of our
software are open-source and community developed (including many contributors
from outside of the lab).


## Fatiando a Terra

A collection of Python tools for geophysics. The Fatiando tools are the heart
of most of our research and teaching efforts.

## Tesseroids

A collection of command-line programs for modeling the gravitational potential,
acceleration, and gradient tensor. Tesseroids supports models and computation
grids in Cartesian and spherical coordinates.
