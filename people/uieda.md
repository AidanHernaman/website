# About

I am Lecturer in Geophysics at the
[Department of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/environmental-sciences/staff/leonardo-uieda/)
of the University of Liverpool, UK.
My research focuses on inverse problems in potential field
geophysics with a heavy dose of open-source software development.
I do my best to bring more openness to the scientific process
and to train the next generation of scientists in the best practices of
reproducible computational experiments.
In the spirit of open-science,
I share all of the research and
teaching material online under permissive licenses.
I'm also fairly active in social media, mostly Twitter.
